## Javascript

## React Native

- [react-native-material-icons](https://github.com/jsonxr/react-native-material-icons) - Google's Material Icons as SVG files. When only using a few icons, much more efficient to use the svg files. react-native-vector-icons did not have the fonts I needed. This also enables me to have a smaller application when I only need a handfull of icons (due to tree shaking).

- [react-native-materialcommunity-icons](https://github.com/jsonxr/react-native-materialcommunity-icons) - When only using a few icons, more efficient to use svg files instead of a font.

- [react-native-fontawesome-icons](https://github.com/jsonxr/react-native-fontawesome-icons) - When only using a few icons, more efficient to use svg files instead of a font.

- [react-native-change](https://github.com/jsonxr/react-native-change) - Tool to rename a react-native application
